- **Course:** Database Development with PL/SQL (INSY 8311)
- **Group:** Wednesday
- **Lecturer:** Eric Maniraguha

### Executive Summary
Phase V involved the implementation of physical database tables and insertion of comprehensive test data. This phase successfully created 5 normalized tables, inserted 1,580+ rows of realistic data, and verified all data integrity requirements. The database is now ready for PL/SQL development in Phase VI.

### Objectives Accomplished
1. Created 5 normalized database tables with proper constraints
2. Inserted 1,580+ rows of realistic test data
3. Verified data integrity through comprehensive validation queries
4. Demonstrated all required query types (SELECT *, Joins, GROUP BY, Subqueries)
5. Implemented business rules and constraint enforcement
6. Prepared database for Phase VI PL/SQL development

### Database Schema Implementation

#### Tables Created
1. **EVENTS** - Main event information (150+ rows)
2. **EXPENSE_CATEGORIES** - Budget categories per event (815+ rows)
3. **EXPENSES** - Individual expense transactions (550+ rows)
4. **HOLIDAYS** - Public holidays for Phase VII restrictions (15 rows)
5. **AUDIT_LOG** - Audit trail for Phase VII requirements (50+ rows)

#### Key Constraints Implemented
- Primary Keys on all tables
- Foreign Keys with CASCADE DELETE
- CHECK constraints for business rules
- NOT NULL constraints for required fields
- UNIQUE constraints where appropriate
- DEFAULT values for common fields

### Data Insertion Details

#### Volume Requirements Met
| Table | Rows Inserted | Requirement | Status |
|-------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| EVENTS | 150+ | 100+ | PASS |
| EXPENSE_CATEGORIES | 815+ | 200+ | PASS |
| EXPENSES | 550+ | 500+ | PASS |
| HOLIDAYS | 15 | 8+ | PASS |
| AUDIT_LOG | 50+ | Sample | PASS |
| **TOTAL** | **1,580+** | **1,000+** | **PASS** |

#### Data Characteristics
- **Realistic Scenarios:** Based on actual event planning scenarios
- **Demographic Mix:** Various event types (Weddings, Conferences, Corporate, Charity, etc.)
- **Edge Cases:** Includes NULL values for testing
- **Business Rules:** All constraints validated
- **Referential Integrity:** Foreign key relationships maintained

### Query Type Demonstrations

#### 1. Basic Retrieval (SELECT *)
All 5 tables successfully return data using SELECT * queries. Sample data from each table has been verified for correctness and completeness.

**Evidence:** `screenshots/test_results/basic_retrieval.jpg`

#### 2. Joins (Multi-table Queries)
Multiple join types demonstrated:
- INNER JOIN for complete event-category-expense chains
- LEFT JOIN for budget vs actual spending analysis
- Multiple table joins with filtering

**Evidence:** `screenshots/test_results/joins_results.jpg`

#### 3. Aggregations (GROUP BY)
Comprehensive statistical analysis performed:
- Event type distribution with COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX
- Payment status analysis
- Monthly expense trends
- Vendor performance metrics

**Evidence:** `screenshots/test_results/aggregations.jpg`

#### 4. Subqueries
All subquery types demonstrated:
- Simple subqueries in WHERE clause
- EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries
- IN subqueries with result sets
- Correlated subqueries
- Nested subqueries for complex analysis

**Evidence:** `screenshots/test_results/subqueries.jpg`

### Data Integrity Verification

#### Validation Results
- All SELECT queries return data: PASS
- All constraints properly enforced: PASS
- Foreign key relationships validated: PASS
- Data completeness verified: PASS
- CASCADE DELETE working correctly: PASS
- No orphaned records found: PASS

**Evidence:** `screenshots/test_results/data_integrity.jpg`

#### Business Rule Enforcement
- No negative budgets or amounts
- Valid payment statuses only (PENDING, PAID, CANCELLED, PARTIAL)
- Unique holiday dates enforced
- Required fields populated
- Default values applied correctly

##  Screenshot Organization

All verification screenshots have been organized in the following structure:

### 1. `screenshots/test_results/`
- `basic_retrieval.jpg` – SELECT * results from all 5 tables  
- `joins_results.jpg` – Multi-table join query outputs  
- `aggregations.jpg` – GROUP BY aggregation results  
- `subqueries.jpg` – Various subquery demonstrations  
- `data_integrity.jpg` – Data integrity verification summary  

### 2. `screenshots/database_objects/`
- Table creation confirmation  
- Constraint definitions  
- Index creation verification  

### 3. `screenshots/oem_monitoring/`
- Database performance metrics (if applicable)  
- Tablespace usage statistics

##  Key Statistics

###  Event Distribution
- **WEDDING:** 40 events (Average budget: RWF 17,097,775)  
- **CORPORATE:** 35 events (Average budget: RWF 10,414,114)  
- **CONFERENCE:** 30 events (Average budget: RWF 27,974,833)  
- **CHARITY:** 25 events (Average budget: RWF 5,781,520)  
- **OTHER:** 14 events (Average budget: RWF 2,166,643)  
- **BIRTHDAY:** 6 events (Average budget: RWF 2,735,333)  

###  Payment Status Distribution
- **PAID:** 300 expenses (54.55% of total)  
- **PENDING:** 200 expenses (36.36% of total)  
- **CANCELLED:** 50 expenses (9.09% of total)  

###  Vendor Analysis
Top 5 vendors by total spending have been identified, with the highest being **Ubumwe Grande Hotel** (63 transactions, RWF 26.9M total).

##  Challenges and Solutions

###  Challenge 1: GROUP BY Syntax Errors
**Issue:** Oracle's strict GROUP BY requirements caused errors in some join queries.  
**Solution:** Used `FETCH FIRST N ROWS ONLY` instead of `ROWNUM` in GROUP BY queries and ensured all non-aggregated columns were included in the GROUP BY clause.

###  Challenge 2: Data Volume Requirements
**Issue:** Meeting the 500+ rows requirement for the expenses table.  
**Solution:** Implemented PL/SQL loops to generate realistic expense data for each category.

###  Challenge 3: Constraint Validation
**Issue:** Verifying all constraints were properly enforced.  
**Solution:** Created comprehensive validation queries that test each constraint type.

##  Conclusion

**Phase V has been successfully completed** with all requirements satisfied. The database is now:

1. **Fully Populated:** 1,580+ rows of realistic data  
2. **Properly Normalized:** 5 tables in 3NF  
3. **Integrity Verified:** All constraints and relationships validated  
4. **Tested:** All query types demonstrated successfully  
5. **Documented:** Comprehensive documentation and screenshots provided  
6. **Ready for Development:** Prepared for Phase VI PL/SQL implementation  

The Event Budget Planner System database now serves as a solid foundation for the advanced PL/SQL development scheduled for Phase VI.

1. Procedures (3–5 required)  
2. Functions (3–5 required)  
3. Cursors and bulk operations  
4. Window functions
